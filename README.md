# candle-business
I created a simple website using HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript for my stepsister. She would like to have a site for her passion in candle making, so I created this for her! This is currently in progress. The candle images and descriptions aren't real, and neither is the contact info.
This is sort of a passion project for fun. I will eventually add actual images and contact info.
